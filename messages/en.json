    "ourStoryDesc": "ISLA was founded in 2019 by an ambitious team that believed in the importance of food as one of life’s essentials, and in the necessity of providing safe, high-quality products , not only for the Egyptian market, but also for European, African, and Arab markets.We cooked in our own homes, experimenting, repeating, adding and removing. We searched for sauces and ingredients that don’t mask the original flavor or create an artificial taste, but rather highlight the true essence of the natural ingredient",
    "ourSECRET": "our secret",
    "ourSecretDes": "Our beginning was not a business idea; it was a small personal attempt to improve what we eat and what we share with those we love. Selecting ingredients carefully, reading, experimenting, and refining became our foundation. Over time, we realized that the real difference doesn’t come from the recipe alone it comes from respect: respect for the source, respect for the original taste, and respect for the body that consumes",

We aim to create a safe space for pure food  food that knows its origin, respects its ingredients, and is served with confidence, not comparison. We want Isla to be present in every home, not because it’s the cheapest or the most widespread, but because it brings peace of mind and restores the true meaning of the table.",
    "mission": "mission",
    "missionDesc": "Every product we create begins with a single question: \"Can we trust this enough to serve it to our own families?\" If the answer isn’t clear… we start over. We select ingredients with care, craft them to preserve their natural flavor and value, and always seek the right balance between quality and fair pricing. Our products are not slogans; they are real results, born from experience, attention, and respect.
